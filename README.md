# NES_Game
An NES game i am working on. Dunno what the game is gonna be about yet. Maybe chasing a cat, Something with an egg that has leggs, or maybe a fighting game. We'll see.
Right now I am calling it Cat Sim. So far you can play as a cat that walks side to side. The background scrolls infinitly. There is also music. 

What I have made so far is mostly from following the Nerdy Nights tutorial. Music is made with FamiStudio and is played in the game with famistudio engine. Graphics are being done with YY-CHR and NEXXT.
